## Future
* Added support for holding down left or right click.

## 8.0.0
* Updated to 1.20.1

## 7.0.1
* Added support for item cooldowns. When an item with a cooldown is used, the cooldown period must elapse before using it again.
  * The previous behavior was that an item with a cooldown could never be used again until the block was broken.
  * This change also means that each clicker is now allocated its own fake player, instead of a shared one per uuid.

## 7.0.0
* Updated to 1.19.2

## 6.0.5
* Follow-up fix to a bug added in 6.0.4, the ray-trace now properly uses the eye position instead of the feet position.
* When the click machine is using items with extra reach distance, the range of the machine will increase accordingly.

## 6.0.4
* Fixed startup crash from registry issues.
* Fixed Click Machine being unable to use buckets.
  * This is done by changing the position of the fake player to be 2 blocks lower, so the eye pos is where the "click" happens from.

## 6.0.3
* Rebuilt for 1.18.2

## 6.0.2
* Updated to Placebo 6.1.0
* Fixed a dupe bug.

## 6.0.1
* Fixed TE data not saving.
* Hav3funDJ: Added Italian Translation.

## 6.0.0
* Updated to 1.18.1

## 5.0.0
* Updated to 1.17.1

## 4.5.0
* Added a dummy rainbow power bar when power is disabled, to hopefully make people realize power is disabled.
* Removed the Energy Capability when power is disabled, so nothing tries to display it.

## 4.4.1
* Made it so the Click Machine fake player cannot be teleported, which crashes normally.

## 4.4.0
* Click Machine has received a brand new GUI! - https://i.imgur.com/7OeVssp.png
